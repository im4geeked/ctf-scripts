# Scripts 

I created this repo because I forget syntax a lot (too much to remember smh) so I collect and make scripts to make my life a bit easier

## What you'll find here
- Small scripts (python, bash) that are intended to do one thing well 
- Simple, minimal code so itâ€™s easy to read and re-use

## Usage 
Run scripts directly (or make them executable) 

```
chmod +x scriptname.sh 
./scriptname.sh
< SNIP >
```

OR 

```
python3 scriptname.py
< SNIP >
```
